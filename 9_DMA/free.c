// free(ptr); - “free” method in C is used to dynamically de-allocate the memory. 
// The memory allocated using functions 
// malloc() and calloc() is not de-allocated on their own. 
// Hence the free() method is used, whenever the dynamic memory allocation takes place. 
// It helps to reduce wastage of memory by freeing
